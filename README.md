# Transmission Control Protocol: TCP

_**What is TCP?** Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. TCP/IP is a network protocol for sending and receiving data through network adapters, routers, and other hardware._

## The Project
This project is a simple, fully-functional TCP chatroom written in Java. It is accessible through the terminal/CLI, has 1 central server, and allows for multiple users to connect and use at the same time.
The TCP functions as any other basic messaging app and contains features such as:
- direct, real-time message exchanging
- personalization features such as changing nicknames
- data preservation
- multithreading

## File Directory
```src``` hosts all the source code for the project. Inside it are two files:
1. the server file ```Server.java```, and
2. the client file ```Client.java```
